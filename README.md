# Food-Delivery
The ‘Food Delivery Web App’ allows a customer to order food from their desired restaurants. This web app is developed using the MERN stack. The basic plot of this web app is that initially, restaurants can create an account with their respective details and food items that will be available to the customer. As the customer chooses a restaurant, he is directed to another page consisting of what the restaurant has to offer (availability will be updated from the restaurant). After the customer chooses the food items and adds them to the cart, he/she can complete the payment by a few methods. The order details are sent to the restaurant, and the customer gets their receipt.
