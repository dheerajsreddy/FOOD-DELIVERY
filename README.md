# Food-Delivery
The ‘Food Delivery Web App’ basically allows a customer to order food from their desired restaurants. This web app is developed using MERN stack.

The basic plot of this web app is that initially restaurants have the option of creating an account with their respective details and food items which will be available to the customer . As the customer chooses a restaurant, he is directed to another page consisting what all the restaurant has got to offer (availability will be updated from the restaurant). After the customer chooses the food items and adds to the cart, he/she can complete the payment by a few methods. The order details are sent to the restaurant and the customer gets their receipt as well.
